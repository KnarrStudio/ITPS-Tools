# ITPS-Tools

## IT PowerShell - Tools:
The idea behind these tools are as follows:
1. Create a series of tools that can be used to help in the day to day tasks or troubleshooting.  I would like to see maybe a menu system put together for some.  Where others would be only used for automations.
2. Colaborate on tools or troubleshooting.
3. Give a home to scripts and remove the bad, unused or "v1.,v2,v3,org,good" versioning from the workplace share or c:\temp
4. Better learn the value of GitHub

## Master, Branches and templates 
- ### Master Branch: 
  This is obviously the main branch and should be kept as close to working tools as possible.  It should be sanitized from any possible company related information.
    
- ### Branches:
  Used to create new tools or work on ones that are in progress.  The branches should be titled something meaningful, so that the work being done can be focused.
    
- ### Templates:
  All scripts, modules and functions need to use the template, so that others who run accross the script can find source and possible updates.
