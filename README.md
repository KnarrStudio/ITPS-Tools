## IT PowerShell - Tools:
The idea behind these tools are as follows:
1. Create a series of tools that can be used to help in the day to day tasks or troubleshooting.  I would like to see maybe a menu system put together for some.  Where others would be only used for automations.
2. Colaborate on tools or troubleshooting.
3. Give a home to scripts and remove the bad, unused or "v1.,v2,v3,org,good" versioning from the workplace share or c:\temp
4. Better learn the value of GitHub
