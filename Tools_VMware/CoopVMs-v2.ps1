Requirements - VMware PowerCLI

This scripts does the following:
- Removes and/or Creates copies (COOPs) of our servers for quick replacement in the case of a server problem
- This could be modified to create the COOP on the SAN, but this is designed to move the files from the SAN to the local ESXi03(6) datastore.
- Reads in server names from the file: COOP-serverlist.csv (This should be in the same dir as this script)
    - Side Note: Future plans will be to remove the list and COOP servers based on tests.  You may see some of the "pre" work already.
- Copies COOP to: ESXi06-LOCALdatastore02
- Write to Host: 214.18.207.89


Versions
1.0 New Script
1.1 Added a confirm statement
1.2 Added 
    -Auto COOP list 
    -File Import COOP list 
    -Removal of old COOP files 
    -Test for File and DC servers 
    -Cleaner Write to Host
1.3 Added Case statement and Functions
1.4 Added 
    -Expanded information in this section
    -Changed some hard data to variables
    -Cleaned up some code
1.5 Removed
    -File import
    Added
    -While Loop
    -Better format for testing vm's
1.6 Added
    - confirm:$true to the "Remove-COOPs" function to prevent acidential deletions
1.6.1 Removed
    - Running all the copies at once was stressing the system so the "-runasync" was removed from create command.  
1.6.2 Modified the "Create COOP" section
    - Added a "clear-host" between each COOP with an actively built list of "Completed" COOPs
1.7 Added "Safety-Switch
    - Added Info-COOP-Snaps to get a dashboard of the VM's that you might be working on.
    -Moved the Menu into a function Menu-Main
